**Author:** Avinash Maskey

## Abstract

Since its inception, the stock market has captivated investors due to its inherent risk and reward. Accurate forecasting of stock indexes remains a challenging and widely researched topic. This project applies Time Series Analysis on the NEPSE index using the ARIMA model to examine its predictive power. The dataset comprises daily closing stock index data from NEPSE, covering approximately eight years. Our findings suggest that the ARIMA model holds significant potential for short-term forecasting in the stock market.
